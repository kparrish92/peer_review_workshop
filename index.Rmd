# Who is Reviewer 2?

.pull-left[
.full-width[
.content-box-grey[
In peer review, your work is often sent to 2-3 anonymous peer reviewers, given the pseudonyms reviewers 1-3.

The character Anton Ego is a bit like a typical **reviewer 2**. 

His perception of himself as an authority on knowledge seems to impact the way he evaluates others and gives feedback.

Academic peer review can have this in common with other forms of evaluation, such as food critics. 

The ultimate goal of peer review, unlike a critic, is to **improve the quality of the final product**, not to poke holes in the work for the sake of poking holes.

# Who is who?

Typically there are three reviewers who give feedback on submitted work in a **double-blind procedure**, where manuscripts are anonymous from the authors and reviews are not signed by reviewers

# How do you even come to peer review a paper? 
Peer-review is a quality control process for academic work. 

---

# The peer review process 

--

You would be contacted by the editor handling the submission to a journal. 

--

This might occur because they know you from a professional meeting, or you have published in their journal before. 

---

# The peer review process 

The process for papers work like this:

--

1. Submit Paper

--

2. Editor is assigned and decides whether to send the paper for reviewers or to desk reject. 

--

3. Reviewers are contacted by the editor directly and asked to review a paper. 

--

4. The editor makes a decision on the manuscript 
  - accept as is
  - accept with minor revisions
  - (major) revisions and resubmit 
  - reject.

--

5. The process repeats for as many rounds as needed, typically with the same reviewers.

# Examples from my own successes and attempts at success

---

# How much do I get paid to review? 

--

**Nothing! :(** - Reviews are unpaid and are considered service to the profession. 

You can list them on your CV, though! 

---

# What approach should I take to reviewing my peers’ work?

**Practice kindness** as much as possible 

It seems like there is an association between anonymity and being a bit mean in the review process.

---

# What approach should I take to reviewing my peers’ work?

--

I use a template, that consists of the following portions (for articles).

--

The template includes:

--

**A summary of the article**: (this is common). The point is to show the author that you understand what they are researching, and if you happen to misunderstand something it would be evident here.

--

**General Comments**: I always started this with a sentence such as "I commend the author(s) on their interesting work. I enjoyed reading the paper, and I am hopeful that my comments can improve the quality of the final product.". Following this, I include a recommendation followed by big-picture justifications. (I recommend major revisions for three primary reasons....)

--

**Specific Comments**: Going section by section and line by line in the manuscript for smaller things like typos or clarifications. 

--

- Some journals also have open reviews - check out Languages, for instance.

# How are conference reviews different from journal reviews? 

Conference reviews are much smaller scale and typically include a rating system with an acceptance threshold.

# How should you read a conference abstract as a reviewer?

I typically look to see if a few points are clear in the often quite limited abstract:


1. **What do we know?**

2. **What do we not yet know?**

3. **How does this paper address this?**

# How should you read a conference abstract as a reviewer?

I typically look to see if a few points are clear in the often quite limited abstract:


1. **What do we know?**: There is evidence that the VOT of L3 learners falls intermediate of their L1 and L2 when we measure it at the group level, rather than the individual one.

2. **What do we not yet know?**

3. **How does this paper address this?**

3. **How does this paper address this?**: Using simulation, it is shown that most published designs do not contain enough data on an individual level to rule out other theoretical predictions and that intermediate group findings are virtually guaranteed when the data set contains more than 500 data points per language.
